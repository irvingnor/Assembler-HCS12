# Assembler-HCS12
This is an assembler for the microprocessor motorola hcs12 that i created for the course of programming systems.
I just created some clases that help me to deal with the file that the user give me. I analyze the file, process, and give the user on file that he can used in the microprocessor.
This project was coded in C#, and I worked on Visual Studio.
